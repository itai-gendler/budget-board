# Split transaction split

## Trigger

The User submits a split amount and classification for the selected entry.

## Outcome

The Product reduces the original Transaction.Amount by the split amount and creates the split Transaction through ordinary creation processing. The signed total is preserved; the new record can be categorized and recurring-matched. Manual-source Balance adjustments follow ordinary ledger effects.

## Edge cases

- An existing dated snapshot is adjusted without creating another same-date snapshot.
